 * @brief The FastBlock class is a Bitcoin Block in canonical form.
 * The FastBlock object is a thin wrapper around a buffer of data which is known to be a Bitcoin block.
 * The class provides access to all parts of the block as expected, but it has no parsing or loading state
 * that it has to go through before you can access it. As such deep-copying is always cheap.
