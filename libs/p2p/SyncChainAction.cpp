     * -----------------------------------------------------------
     *
     * The goal is to get various peers to agree on what is the 'tip'.
     * These peers should also come from different sections of the Internet
     * since most of the sybils would end up with very similar IPs. (TODO)
     *
     * We require each of those peers to have done a 'getheaders' call as the
     * system will disconnect any peer that doesn't agree with the longest chain
     * and our checkpoints.
     *
     * Last, we use the date to guestimate the chain-height so we know we are
     * stuck on a dead couple of nodes if stay get behind too much.
