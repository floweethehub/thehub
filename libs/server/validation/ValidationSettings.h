 * @brief The Validation::Settings can be used to set settings and also is a Future for a block being validated.
 *
 * The Block validation code is entirely a-synchronous. Adding a block will return immediately and processing
 * will happen in a separate worker thread.
 *
 * The method Validation::Engine:addBlock() returns an instance of Settings. This instance allows you
 * to set more settings on the block before the actual validation starts and also it allows you to introspect
 * information about the validation as it happens in the background.
 *
 * Notice that this means that should you keep a copy of the Settings, you delay validation until either
 * the settings object has its destructor run, or you explicitly call start();
