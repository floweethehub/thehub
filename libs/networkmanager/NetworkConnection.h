/**
 * An instance gives access to a client-server connection.
 * The NetworkManager has getters to create NetworkConnection instances, once
 * one is successfully created you can use it like a remote server that you can
 * post messages to, get messages from (using setOnIncomingMessage()) and it will
 * automatically reconnect and resend messages on failures.
 *
 * The NetworkConnection is a very light-weight class for
 * easy access to a certain connection.  It is used as a value-class and as such it has
 * an isValid() method to allow checking if the connection it represents still exists.
 * For instance when the NetworkManager that owns all the connections is deleted, this
 * will return false.
 *
 * Callbacks are registered with one instance of a NetworkConnection, and when that
 * instance goes out of scope the callbacks will be destructed as well.
 * Simplest usage is thus something like this;
 * @code
