/**
 * @brief The UnspentOutput class is a mem-mappable "leaf" in the UnspentOutputDatabase.
 *
 * A single unspentOutput instance maps to a single UTXO entry.
 * With the information in this class you can open the relevant block and find the transaction
 * to iterate over in order to find the output that is being refered to.
 * In other words, this is mostly just an index onto the actual block-chain which actually stores
 * the real unspent output.
