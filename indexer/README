Indexer

There are 2 executables in this directory;
* indexer
* indexer-cli

The first is meant to be run as a server, connecting to a running instance
of the Hub, and making available services of its own. By default listening
on port 1234.

The indexer-cli app is essentially a testing application for this service,
but likely people can find nice usages for it as-is.

# Setup Indexer
###############

The indexer has the following --help message;

    Usage: ./bin/indexer [options]
    Indexing server

    Options:
      -h, --help             Displays this help.
      --datadir, -d <DIR>    The directory to put the data in
      --conf <FILENAME>      config file
      --version              Display version
      --connect <ADDRESS>  server location and port
      --bind <IP-ADDRESS>    Bind to this IP:port

The indexer has two (optional) indexes it can make and those take a good
amount of space and a relatively large amount of time to build.
They both store data (various gigabytes of it) in a datadirectory.
The default is `~/.local/share/flowee/indexer`, you can pass a different
directory to the command line to change this.

To connect to a running Hub you can pass an hostname:port string to the
--connect commandline argument, or you can specify it in the config file.
See below for an example config file.

TO allow others to connect you can bind to one or more addresses by
providing one or more --bind options on the commandline or providing
the connection data in the config file.

# Indexer-cli example usage
###########################

Usage: ./indexer/indexer-cli [options] [TXID|ADDRESS]
Indexing client

Options:
  -h, --help             Displays this help.
  --hub <HOSTNAME>       Hub server address
  --version              Display version
  --connect <ADDRESS>  server location and port
  --verbose, -v          Be more verbose
  --quiet, -q            Be quiet, only errors are shown

Arguments:
  [TXID|ADDRESS]         The things you want to lookup


Here a simple output of the lookup of a transaction, by txid.
The first line prints the transaction location. Which is a block-height and
an offset-in-block (in bytes).
In this case we also connect the 'cli' app to a running Hub and thus we
manage to get the actual transaction as well.

Note; the '8000' on both lines is the logging category of the indexer
component.
